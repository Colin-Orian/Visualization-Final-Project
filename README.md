# Description
This project contains a visualization system of OpenAlex articles collected by Toupin et al https://www.cogitatiopress.com/oceanandsociety/article/view/8924/4178. The dataset they created can be found in the  `data` folder.

All the icons in the `res` folder were made by me using Krita. 

# Running the System
Assuming you are on Windows, executing  the `launchServer.bat` file will start up a Python server on `http://localhost:8080/`. Once the server is running, you can view the system at the local host address using your prefered web browser.

# Requirements
Python Version 3 is required to run the server.
