"1"	"6B"	1	4	"Marine invertebrates"	"As of 2019, 153,434 marine benthic invertebrate species had been described globally. • Since 2012, researchers have described 10,777 new marine benthic invertebrate species; at the same time, biodiversity is changing globally at rates unprecedented in human history, creating the potential for species extinction before they have been described. • The deep sea covers 43 per cent of the Earth’s surface, with an estimated 95 per cent of marine invertebrate species still undescribed. • Major pressures on marine invertebrates include temperature increase, ocean acidification, physical impacts on the seabed, the extraction of living and non-living resources, coastal use, invasive species and pollution. • Large areas of the globe, including areas beyond national jurisdiction, still lack effective and adequate long-term ecosystem monitoring and protection for marine invertebrates. • Despite new research regarding many important ecosystem processes, functions, goods and services, huge knowledge gaps remain in understanding the impact of reductions in benthic invertebrate biodiversity on human well-being and ecosystem dynamics. "
"2"	"6E"	1	4	"Marine reptiles"	"Changes in the conservation status of marine turtles since the first World Ocean Assessment (United Nations, 2017a) are highly variable, with some populations experiencing positive growth rates, while others have experienced catastrophic declines. • The conservation status of most sea snake and marine iguana populations  has not changed since the first Assessment, although huge data gaps remain. The main threats to marine reptiles remain similar to those recorded in the first Assessment. By-catch is the most significant threat, although targeted harvesting, marine pollution, habitat loss, coastal development, disease and climate change are also key threatening processes."
"3"	"7A"	1	4	"Intertidal zone"	"The intertidal zone encompasses many different habitats on the world’s coasts. • A large proportion of humans live in proximity to the intertidal zone. • Human activities affect the intertidal zone directly, through coastal modification, and indirectly, through climate change. Despite our close relationship with intertidal habitats, key knowledge gaps remain and taxonomic infrastructure is needed in developing countries to resolve baseline data."
"4"	"7N"	1	4	"Open ocean"	"Global warming is already affecting the open ocean, and marine heatwaves are likely to increase in frequency and strength in the future. • Climate change-induced changes in the open ocean biological pump will alter the ocean’s ability to take up anthropogenic carbon. • Deoxygenation of the open ocean is already leading to habitat compression for some pelagic species, with subsequent impacts on their vertical and horizontal distribution in the ocean. • Increasing fluxes of plastic litter from the land are affecting open ocean ecosystems. • A critical knowledge gap exists for deep pelagic (e.g., mesopelagic and bathypelagic) environments, as they are poorly sampled and understood."
"5"	"11"	2	5	"Changes in liquid and atmospheric inputs to the marine environment from land (including through groundwater), ships and offshore installations"	"\"Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) continue to be a global issue, persisting at concentrations likely to cause biological effects. • POPs are detected in remote locations far from their source of production, which includes the deepest parts of the ocean and the polar regions. • The number of POPs continues to increase and thus the mixtures to which biota are exposed become more complex, making the determination of the likelihood of individual or population effects ever more challenging. Metals • There is a critical need to develop and expand coastal metal time series globally. • Trends in metal concentrations vary regionally, although most show levelling of dissolved metals and a slight increase in higher trophic organisms. Radioactivity • There have been	 no significant nuclear accidents	affecting the oceans since the first World Ocean Assessment (United Nations, 2017c). • The generation of electricity from nuclear power plants continues to increase, with an increase of	about 5 per cent	globally	between 2013 and 2018. Improved technology may be reducing discharges of many radionuclides, but those of tritium are probably increasing in line with electricity generation. Tritium is, however, only weakly radioactive. • Published information on recent discharges of radioactive substances to the ocean from nuclear power plants and nuclear reprocessing plants is not available except for the North-East Atlantic and its adjacent seas. In that area, discharges to the ocean of radioactive substances from nuclear power plants and nuclear reprocessing plants continue to decline. • On the basis of the information available, there is no reason to think that adverse impacts of radioactivity on the ocean have become significantly worse since the situation was reported in the first Assessment. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products • Hundreds of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been detected in the ocean, including in the Arctic and Antarctic. • Novel analytical techniques have been developed for non-target analysis of PPCPs and their transformation products in the marine environment. • A “watch list” of PPCPs should be formulated and incorporated into long-term international, national and regional monitoring programmes to serve as a scientific data basis for assessing the status of PPCPs in the ocean. Shipping • There is a globally decreasing trend regarding shipping accidents leading to oil spills (over 7 tons), and regionally	improved surveillance and action capabilities indicate increased awareness leading to fewer spills. • There is a general knowledge gap on the nature and impact of liquid input from ships, and the discharge of water from exhaust	gas cleaning systems (scrubbers) is an emerging source of metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. 103World Ocean	Assessment II: Volume	II Hydrocarbons • Produced water from oil and gas exploration containing both hydrocarbons and metals is known to affect the marine environment, but knowledge gaps exist on the long-term impact of produced water discharges. There is a need for further studies at the community and population levels to advance the current knowledge on single species toxicity data. • An increased rate of offshore platform decommissioning poses a challenge for the marine environment.\""
"6"	"20"	2	5	"Trends in inputs of anthropogenic noise into the marine environment"	"The main anthropogenic noise sources in the ocean include vessels, industrial activity, including seismic exploration and renewable energy development, and sonar. • Anthropogenic noise levels vary across space and time, the primary drivers being levels of human activity and propagation characteristics in the region. Noise does not persist once the sound source has been removed from the environment, although impacts can potentially persist. • Areas with the highest levels of anthropogenic noise are those characterized by heavy industrial use, such as the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean. • Areas where anthropogenic noise is expected to increase include the Arctic, as the area opens up to shipping, and Africa, as investment in the region expands. • Understanding of the impacts of anthropogenic noise on marine biodiversity is increasing, in parallel with a growing recognition of the need to monitor and possibly reduce the noise entering the marine environment."
"7"	"2"	1	2	"Approach to the assessment"	"The purpose of the second World Ocean Assessment is to update the first World Ocean Assessment by providing an understanding of changes that have occurred in the global ocean since 2010 and associated trends. • The Assessment also provides an overview of understanding of some aspects not fully covered in the first Assessment, such as inputs of anthropogenic noise, marine hydrates, cumulative effects, marine spatial planning and management approaches. • The Assessment follows a modified approach to the drivers-pressures-state-impact-response framework, supported through a series of workshops aimed at identifying region-specific information and input for the Assessment, a peer-review process and a process of review by States."
"8"	"5"	1	4	"Trends in the physical and chemical state of the ocean"	"Thermal expansion from a warming ocean and land ice melt are the main causes of the accelerating global rise in the mean sea level. • Global warming is also affecting many circulation systems. The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation has already weakened and will most likely continue to do so in the future. The impacts of ocean circulation changes include a regional rise in sea levels, changes in the nutrient distribution and carbon uptake of the ocean and feedbacks with the atmosphere, such as altering the distribution of precipitation. • More than 90 per cent of the heat from global warming is stored in the global ocean. Oceans have exhibited robust warming since the 1950s from the surface to a depth of 2,000 m. The proportion of ocean heat content has more than doubled since the 1990s compared with long-term trends. Ocean warming can be seen in most of the global ocean, with a few regions exhibiting long-term cooling. • The ocean shows a marked pattern of salinity changes in multidecadal observations, with surface and subsurface patterns providing clear evidence of a water cycle amplification over the ocean. That is manifested in enhanced salinities in the near-surface, high-salinity subtropical regions and freshening in the low-salinity regions such as the West Pacific Warm Pool and the poles.An increase in atmospheric CO2 levels, and a subsequent increase in carbon in the oceans, has changed the chemistry of the oceans to include changes to pH and aragonite saturation. A more carbon-enriched marine environment, especially when coupled with other environmental stressors, has been demonstrated through field studies and experiments to have negative impacts on a wide range of organisms, in particular those that form calcium carbonate shells, and alter biodiversity and ecosystem structure. • Decades of oxygen observations allow for robust trend analyses. Long-term measurements have shown decreases in dissolved oxygen concentrations for most ocean regions and the expansion of oxygen-depleted zones. A temperature-driven solubility decrease is responsible for most near-surface oxygen loss, though oxygen decrease is not limited to the upper ocean and is present throughout the water column in many areas. • Total sea ice extent has been declining rapidly in the Arctic, but trends are insignificant in the Antarctic. In the Arctic, the summer trends are most striking in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean, while, in the Antarctic, the summer trends show increases in the Weddell Sea and decreases in the West Antarctic sector of the Southern Ocean. Variations in sea ice extent result from changes in wind and ocean currents."
"9"	"6A"	1	4	"Plankton"	"Single-celled microbes are the most abundant and diverse form of marine life. Food webs based on them sustain most ocean biodiversity. • Marine phytoplankton account for about 50 per cent of the Earth’s primary production, oxygen supply and N2-fixation. Diatoms and picoplankton (< 2 µm) account for most marine primary production. • Driven by upper-ocean warming, increases in the vertical separation of layers of water (stratification) and decreases in inorganic nutrient inputs to the part of the ocean where photosynthesis is possible (the euphotic zone) are likely to result in: • Decreases in phytoplankton productivity and cell size; • Increases in energy flow through microbial food webs relative to that through metazoan food webs (plankton > 20 µm); • Decreases in the export of biological production to the deep ocean. Such decreases would reduce the capacity of the ocean to absorb CO2 , accelerating global atmospheric warming; • Decrease in biological production of higher trophic level. • Climate-driven ocean acidification may reduce the abundance and distribution of calcareous plankton. • Current global ocean observations do not specifically monitor plankton diversity. An international, integrated observing system of ocean life is needed as a component of the Global Earth Observing System of Systems."
"10"	"6C"	1	4	"Fishes"	"The mobilization of existing data and the development of tools and open, global repositories provide a global picture of the diversity of marine fishes, with 17,762 known species, including 238 species described since the first World Ocean Assessment (United Nations, 2017e). • While knowledge of the biodiversity of marine fishes exceeds that of many other marine taxa, further improvements will be necessary not only in taxonomic and biosystematic infrastructure but also in the exploration and characterization of the oceans to achieve a complete inventory. • More than half of the known marine fish species have had their conservation status assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and approximately a third of those assessments having been conducted since the first Assessment. • Of the fish species with conservation assessments, around 6 per cent of bony fishes, nearly 50 per cent of elasmobranchs, 10 per cent of chimaeras and both species of coelacanths are threatened or near threatened with extinction. • Capacity for documenting and understanding marine fish diversity continues to grow, but significant gaps remain for certain ecosystem groups (e.g., mesopelagic fishes) and in predicting responses to multiple simultaneous external stressors."
"11"	"6D"	1	4	"Marine mammals"	"Marine mammals play a key role in marine ecosystems in terms of biomass, consumption and energy transfer and continue to provide significant economic and cultural contributions to coastal communities. • The number of species for which a conservation status is available has increased, with eight species no longer in a status of data deficiency as a result of new information. Thirty-six per cent of baleen whale species are increasing in abundance. Overall, the status of coastal dolphins, sirenians and both marine species of otters is deteriorating, with the vaquita close to extinction. Many species lack population abundance information. • Fishery by-catch continues to be a dominant conservation threat for many species. Indirect threats, such as habitat alteration, overfishing of prey, land-based pollution, anthropogenic noise, ship strikes and disturbances, are becoming more prevalent, in particular in coastal zones. • There is apparent increasing consumption of hunted and by-caught small marine mammals in some coastal developing nations."
"12"	"6F"	1	4	"Seabirds"	"Since the first World Ocean Assessment (United Nations, 2017), the global conservation status of seabirds has worsened, continuing a long-term trend. • Thirty-one per cent of species are now threatened with extinction, up from 28 per cent in 2010. • Pressures related to fishing (by-catch and prey depletion) are now affecting more species, while pollution is affecting fewer species (although marine debris, especially plastics, is an emerging threat with poorly understood consequences). • Invasive alien species and climate change also remain major causes of seabird decline and affect a number of species similar to that in 2010. • Current capacity and resources limit the ability to assess consequences at the population level and the implications for ecosystem services of existing and emerging threats."
"13"	"6G"	1	4	"Marine plants and macroalgae"	"Some 90 per cent of mangrove, seagrass and marsh plant species have been assessed as being at risk of extinction; 19 per cent of mangroves, 21 per cent of seagrass species and one marsh plant species are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. • Among macroalgae, 1 species of red seaweed from Australia (Vanvoorstia bennettiana) is listed as Extinct, 10 species (six red algae and four brown algae) are listed as Critically Endangered, 1 species of brown alga is listed as Endangered, and 4 species (three red algae and one brown alga) are listed as Vulnerable. The number of macroalgal species assessed and reported in the IUCN Red List is less than 1 per cent of the total number of species listed in the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS). All 15 threatened species are endemic to the Galapagos Islands, and 47 species have been assessed as at a risk of extinction in the Mediterranean. This highlights the knowledge gap with regard to macroalgae. • In terms of macroalgal endemism, Antarctica ranks highest, with 27 per cent endemics, followed by South America (22 per cent) and the Red Sea Large Marine Ecosystem (9 per cent). • New techniques such as genomics have been developed for species identification and for elucidating phylogenetic relationships. As a result, the number of species is expected to rise, especially for macroalgae; however, owing to uneven human and infrastructure capacities among regions, some regions will be less studied than others. "
"14"	"7B"	1	4	"Biogenic reefs and sandy, muddy and rocky shore substrates"	"Biogenic reefs and sandy, muddy and rocky shores support high biodiversity and a wide range of ecosystem services that benefit human populations. • They are under pressure from multiple stressors as a result of climate change, urbanization and the use of resources; storms, land reclamation, contaminants and pollutants have emerged as the main drivers. "
"15"	"7C"	1	4	"Atoll and island lagoons"	"The health of atolls and island lagoons and the sustainability of the communities that depend on them for their livelihoods are challenged by many environmental limitations and stressors, often exacerbated by human actions. • Islands on atolls and on other coral reefs are low- lying and very vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, in particular sea level rise; individual islands are likely to respond in different ways. • Climate change threatens coral reef ecosystems, with implications for the habitability of islands. Coral bleaching, the erosion and inundation of islands, carbonate dissolution and the effects of extreme events, such as tropical storms, are of particular significance. • Developed urban atoll islands are increasingly dependent on engineering solutions, which need to integrate “hard” and “green/ blue” options to avoid unintended impacts, whereas less populated rural island communities rely on the health, productivity and function of surrounding marine and coastal ecosystems."
"16"	"7D"	1	4	"Tropical and subtropical coral reefs"	"Global declines in coral cover continue, primarily owing to increasing ocean temperatures associated with climate change, as well as extractive activities, pollution and sedimentation, novel coral diseases and the physical destruction of coral reefs. • The frequency of disturbances caused by heatwaves, storms, flooding and crown-ofthorns starfish outbreaks has increased, resulting in a decrease in recovery time between disturbances. • The understanding of the value of ecosystem services provided by coral reefs is improving, not only in terms of direct economic benefits (market use value), but also through less tangible use, such as aesthetic value. • Substantial knowledge gaps remain, in particular with regard to responses of coral reef communities to climate change and how those responses might influence human use of coral reefs. • Projections of future states suggest continued decreases in coral abundance, reef-associated fishes and the architectural complexity of reef frameworks."
"17"	"7E"	1	4	"Cold water corals"	"Cold water coral and sponge ecosystems are common features along continental margins and mid-ocean ridges and on seamounts worldwide, providing habitats for numerous species and contributing to carbon sequestration. • Basic knowledge of cold water coral biology and distribution is still limited to the few areas of the deep ocean that have been explored. • Threats from fishing, offshore oil drilling, deep-sea mining, waste deposition and climate change continue. Some efforts to curb demersal trawling and establish marine protected areas have been effective. However, because of their slow-growing and long-lived nature, recovery from anthropogenic impacts can take decades to centuries. • Cold water corals are highly sensitive to elevated temperatures and deoxygenation, but recent work suggests they are relatively resilient to ocean acidification, in particular when nutritional resources are plentiful. • Future projected declines in cold water coral abundance will reduce the habitat available to commercially significant species, reduce carbon sequestration in deep waters, eliminate potential genetic resources and have an effect on numerous Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goal 14, but also Goals 2, 10, and 12."
"18"	"7F"	1	4	"Estuaries and deltas"	"Human populations, fishing, shipping, engineering activities, including upstream river dams, and recreation and tourism exert pressures on the resources and health of estuaries and deltas. Interactions between multiple stressors on estuary and delta habitats are not fully understood. • A key gap remains in identifying measurable indices of ecosystem health and human well-being across diverse estuarine and deltaic systems."
"19"	"7G"	1	4	"Seagrass meadows"	"Seagrass meadows continue to decline at alarming rates, in particular where they are in conflict with human activities. • Marine ecosystems are reconfigured as a result of climate-driven changes in species distributions, with some species projected to be functionally extinct by 2100. Blue carbon sequestration will play a role in mitigating climate change impacts. • Successful long-term solutions around conservation and restoration will require a balance between social, economic and environmental drivers."
"20"	"7H"	1	4	"Mangroves"	"Despite their ecological and socioeconomic importance, especially as carbon sinks, mangrove forest areas have been decreasing annually. • Although deforestation continues in most areas, afforestation and the replanting of mangroves on all continents have partially decreased the speed of mangrove area loss from about 2 per cent per year to less than 0.4 per cent per year. • Increasing human population density and unplanned development in the coastal zone are the main threats to mangrove forests. Global climatic change, such as rising sea levels and temperature, is causing expansion of mangroves towards the poles and landward into salt marsh in some areas. • Local actions and international agreements have helped mangrove conservation, but bureaucracy and the lack of commitment on the part of local, state, and national governments, and local communities have limited their success. "
"21"	"7I"	1	4	"Salt marshes"	"Salt marshes, as defined in the first World Ocean Assessment (United Nations, 2017) are intertidal, coastal systems that are regularly flooded with salt or brackish water and dominated by salt-tolerant plants adapted to regular or occasional immersion by tides. • Salt marshes serve as nesting, nursery and feeding grounds for numerous species of birds, fishes, molluscs and crustaceans, including some commercially important species. • Salt marshes are very effective “blue carbon” sinks, as they sequester CO2 owing to their high levels of primary production and low rates of decomposition, but they can also produce greenhouse gas emissions. • Salt marsh area is declining globally despite protective measures in many areas. Sea level rise poses the biggest threat, and marshes must either increase their elevation to keep pace with rising seas or move inland. Since the first Assessment, that has changed from a future issue to a present reality. If coastal development or restrictions on sediment supply and delivery make either adjustment difficult, salt marshes are converted to mudflats and open water. • Many marshes worldwide are already showing signs of waterlogging, which indicates that they are not elevating rapidly enough. • Some evidence suggests that marshes with certain invasive plants may be better able to keep up with sea level rise."
"22"	"7J"	1	4	"Continental slopes and submarine canyons"	"Continental slopes represent 5.2 per cent of the ocean, with over one fifth of the slope comprised of submarine canyons; they are critical transition areas between the continental shelf and the deep sea and are important for carbon burial and as habitats for species of ecological and economic importance. • Strong vertical hydrographic gradients, complex geomorphic features and fluid f luxes from the sea floor make canyon and slope faunal communities highly heterogeneous. • Hundreds of newly discovered methane seep, coral and sponge habitats enhance biodiversity and host novel interactions with surrounding sediments. • Canyons can be hotspots of biological activity but their communities do not always differ from those on adjacent slopes, which are also highly productive; slope and basin sediments can be an archive of historical information about climate effects on biodiversity. • Naturally occurring oxygen minimum zones reveal that biodiversity is highly sensitive to oxygenation; expansion of low oxygen zones will reduce biodiversity; projected declines in pH and food supply are likely to affect cold water coral ecosystems. Owing to their proximity to shore, slopes and canyons are subject to expansion of deepwater oil and gas activities, offshore energy installations, bottom fisheries and, potentially, mineral mining activities, as well as to increasing contamination, including litter and mine tailings from land. • Exploration has accelerated the discovery of new ecosystem functions and services, including novel productivity and carbon transfer mechanisms, nursery grounds, and contaminant and waste transfer. However, most canyons and slope areas remain largely unexplored, with major questions about species ranges, ecological connectivity, benthopelagic linkages, sensitivity to climate and direct disturbance remaining unanswered, in particular in the southern hemisphere and along African and South American margins.  • Better integration of climate science, connectivity research, conservation biology and resource management, combined with increased taxonomic and geographic expertise, will improve the distribution of knowledge, technology, analytical tools and methodologies required to advance global understanding and promote sustainability of slope and canyon ecosystems."
"23"	"7K"	1	4	"High-latitude ice"	"High-latitude ice habitats are characterized by high, but geographically variable, declines in sea ice extent as a consequence of climate change. • The loss of Arctic sea ice habitat and Antarctic ice shelves allows expansion of both pelagic and benthic species into the newly open water environments. • In general, however, many ice-dependent species are decreasing in abundance and their spatial distributions may also be reducing, in particular in the Arctic. Decreasing sea ice extent in the Arctic provides increased opportunities for a range of human activities, including fishing, navigation and hydrocarbon exploration, with positive implications for several Sustainable Development Goals.1 • Many of those activities, however, will remain marginal for some time as a seasonally ice-free Arctic is not expected until later in the century. • Decreasing sea ice will, however, reduce local community access to subsistence hunting opportunities. "
"24"	"7L"	1	4	"Seamounts and pinnacles"	"Seamounts and pinnacles are common topographic features of the global ocean. • Sampling effort has increased in recent years but only a small percentage of seamounts has been sampled in detail. • Limited sampling, combined with high environmental variability among seamounts, constrains biodiversity knowledge. • Fishing, especially bottom trawling, constitutes the greatest current threat to seamount ecosystems but marine debris or litter, climate change and potential seabed mining are additional concerns. However, initiatives to protect seamounts are increasing. • Recent time series research on deep seamounts shows limited, if any, recovery of stony coral communities over 15–20-year periods."
"25"	"7M"	1	4	"Abyssal plains"	"The abyss lies between 3 and 6 km water depth and covers more of the Earth’s surface than all other habitats combined. • The present chapter is the first in the World Ocean Assessment that is dedicated to the abyss, covering biodiversity, regional differences, biogeography, and changes and impacts as a result of natural stressors and anthropogenic activity. • Abyssal biodiversity is not well understood, and many gaps exist in the current understanding of abyssal evolution and biogeography, as well as the distributions, connectivity and responses of organisms to changing conditions. •  Fragmentary knowledge of abyssal taxonomy is largely the result of difficulties in sampling the vast and remote area and, hence, limited research effort, which hinders the advancement of scientific knowledge. • Most abyssal environments support the processes that drive deep-sea and global ecosystem functioning and are linked closely to surface production and pelagic processes. • Climate change and anthropogenic impacts affect the abyss, despite its remoteness."
"26"	"7O"	1	4	"Ridges, plateaux and trenches"	"Most recent studies of ridge biology address chemosynthetic environments (see chap. 7P). • Climate change models show that bathyal environments will suffer a reduction in pH, which will affect benthic communities. • Ridges, rises, plateaux and banks are under human pressure arising from existing and potential exploitation of resources, while evidence of pollution in trenches is accumulating. • The vulnerability of those ecosystems to human pressures has triggered both increased societal awareness and new regulations."
"27"	"7P"	1	4	"Hydrothermal vents and cold seeps"	"Hydrothermal vents and cold seeps have uniquely complex habitats and communities, diverse endemic species, high biomass and productivity supported by chemosynthesis. • Such ecosystems are sources of biotechnological and biomedical innovation. • They play a significant role in global ocean processes, sequestering CO2 and methane, and contributing to surface ocean productivity through iron export. • In the past five years, explorations using new tools to detect water column signals located thousands of new vent fields and cold seeps. • Resource exploration (polymetallic sulphides and methane hydrates) and the need to map and protect vulnerable habitats and species support recent investigations. • The International Seabed Authority has issued seven polymetallic sulphide exploration contracts since 2011, encompassing vent fields from the mid-ocean ridges of the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. • Vulnerable marine ecosystems and marine protected areas in exclusive economic zones and in areas beyond national jurisdiction protect some vents and seeps. • The conservation status of vents or seeps identified eight areas protected under national law within exclusive economic zones. • Knowledge gaps include spatial and temporal patterns, impacts from direct disturbance, changes to deepwater circulation, deoxygenation, warming and acidification. • Ocean warming triggering gas hydrate dissociation is a major stressing factor to cold seepage activity and ecosystems. • Capacity-building is a priority, in particular in island States. "
"28"	"7Q"	1	4	"Sargasso Sea"	"The Sargasso Sea is an area of the high seas that is internationally recognized as a fundamentally important part of the global ocean because of its role in climate regulation and its unique ecosystems. • The Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study continues to collect observations enabling inferences on the impact of climate change in the ocean and increased understanding of ocean processes. Continuation of that fundamental long-term research is essential. • Mass blooms and strandings of Sargassum since 2011 are attributable to a previously rare form of Sargassum natans. They are causing major socioeconomic problems for the region and may also adversely affect unique oceanic Sargassum communities. • The importance of the Sargasso Sea as a spawning area for both the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) and the American eel (Anguilla rostrata) has been emphasized by satellite tracking of adults and widespread larval surveys. An increased understanding of the ecology of commercial tuna and tuna-like species and awareness of the use of the area by endangered and threatened species is increasing the need for ecosystem-based fisheries management. • Most changes and threats, including climate change, overfishing of eels, plastic pollution and mass blooms of Sargassum, are externally driven. Those increasing threats will adversely affect the contribution of the Sargasso Sea to Sustainable Development Goal 14 to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development and, therefore, other Goals.1 • The increasing activity in the Sargasso Sea demonstrates the importance of addressing the cumulative impacts of human activities on the high seas."
"29"	"8A"	2	4	"Coastal communities and maritime industries"	"\"About 40 per cent of the	world’s population lives in the coastal zone, that is, within 100 km	of the coast. The proportion is increasing. • Coastal communities play a key role in supporting all components of the ocean economy, as well as a range of social and cultural values, and all forms of coastal and marine management and governance. While coastal communities often have to deal with physical and social vulnerabilities, they are crucial contributors to conservation, to marine hazard responses and to climate mitigation and adaptation. • The ocean supports a wide range of economic activities, including the harvesting of food, shipping, seabed mining, offshore hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation, tourism and recreation, use of marine genetic resources, production of fresh water by desalinization and production of salt. The various economic activities are steadily growing in scale. Separate chapters in part 5 of the present Assessment, on trends in pressures on the marine environment, give more detail on areas not discussed in depth here. • Shipping carries about 90 per cent by volume of international trade, which makes it fundamental to the global economy. It is still recovering from the economic crisis of the period 2008–2011. • Globally, tourism continues to grow at about 6 per cent per year. Coastal tourism represents a substantial proportion of overall economic activity for many countries, especially small island developing States and archipelagic States. • Shipping and tourism have been seriously dislocated by the COVID-19 pandemic. • Desalinization continues to grow in importance, in particular in the Middle East, North Africa and small island States and archipelagic States. Sea salt production also continues at a generally steady level, but accounts for only about one eighth of total salt production. \""
"30"	"8B"	2	4	"Human health as affected by the ocean"	"There are both health benefits and risks to living near the sea. The advantages can include enhanced air quality, exercise opportunities, novel marine-derived pharmaceuticals and ready access to food from the sea, which itself has health benefits (as a source of protein and essential micronutrients), although seafood is also traded inland; as well as sources of renewable energy. • The ocean presents health risks from tsunamis, storms and tropical cyclones. Humans are also subject to increased risks from contaminated food from the sea, sea level rise and storms and cyclones from climate change. Chemical contaminants (including air pollution particulates), harmful or toxic algal blooms and pathogens pose health risks, in particular in estuarine and coastal waters where there is adjacent urbanization and/or recreational usage. • Novel pollutants, such as antibiotics, hormones, nanomaterials (e.g., fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, metallic nanoparticles and nanoplastics) and microplastics, are a cause for concern. Combustion nanoparticles (e.g., PM2.5 ) as a major component of air pollution, are well established as contributing to cardiovascular disease and lung cancer. "
"31"	"9"	2	5	"Pressures from changes in climate and atmosphere"	"\"Extreme climate events. Marine heatwaves and tropical cyclones are shown to be increasing in severity owing to human activities and are having an impact on nature and human societies. Extreme El Niño events have been observed but, because they	occur	infrequently, a human influence	has not been detected. All three phenomena are projected to increase in the future, with the severity of impacts also increasing, but such increases can be reduced by climate change mitigation efforts. • Sea level rise. The alarming observed pace of sea level rise, combined with increasing storminess and coastal urbanization, has resulted in the	amplified susceptibility	of coastal cities	to erosion and flooding	and increased the need for substantial investments in hard infrastructure and the restoration of natural barriers, such as reefs. • Ocean acidification and deoxygenation. The accelerated increase of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere is creating an increase	in the acidification and deoxygenation of the ocean. Under such conditions, both in nature and in the laboratory, marine organisms that support ecosystems and human livelihoods and nutrition typically respond poorly. Marine habitats experience a loss of diversity, many long-lived organisms die and a few resilient species proliferate. Less serious damage to life-supporting ecosystems would be possible under lower-emission scenarios. • Other physical and chemical properties. Changes in ocean temperature and salinity induced by climate change and human activities are affecting marine ecosystems by changing the distribution of marine species, decreasing the ecological value of coastal ecosystems and changing marine primary production. Human well-being and the economy are consequently affected.\""
"32"	"10"	2	5	"Changes in nutrient inputs to the marine environment"	"\"Inputs of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to coastal ecosystems through river runoff and atmospheric deposition increased rapidly during the twentieth century owing to anthropogenic inputs derived primarily from the use of synthetic fertilizer, combustion of fossil fuels, cultivation of legumes (N2-fixation), production	of manure by livestock and municipal wastes. • Increases in anthropogenic nutrient inputs have fuelled a global increase in cultural eutrophication of the coastal ocean and now exceed inputs owing to natural processes. • Ecological responses to the process of cultural eutrophication include increases in the severity and extent of coastal hypoxia, acidification and toxic algal events.	Thus, cultural eutrophication is a serious threat to the health of coastal ecosystems and their capacity to provide services that are valued by society. • It is projected that anthropogenic N and P production will increase by nearly a factor of two during the first half of the twenty-first century. • Reducing anthropogenic inputs of N and P to the coastal ocean to minimize the extent and risk of coastal eutrophication during the	course of the twenty-first century should be an international priority. \""

Amounts of marine litter are increasing in remote and unpopulated areas. • Time series data are needed to assess and monitor impacts of marine litter, including microplastics and nanoplastics. • Although a decreasing trend is observed, there is a need to harmonize reporting on dumping at sea."
"34"	"13"	2	5	"Changes in erosion and sedimentation"	"\"Coastal erosion can lead to coastal retreat, habitat destruction and loss of land, which result in significant	negative ecological and socioeconomic impacts on the global coastal zones. • Sediment budget and geology determine coastal morphology and dynamics, which influence the nature and health of coastal ecosystems. Human activities affecting the sediment dynamics, both on the coast and on land, modify the naturally occurring patterns of erosion and sedimentation. • Globally, the abstraction or interruption of sediment supplies to and along the coast has been increasing, through upstream dams, coastal and river sand mining, and coastal infrastructures. Reduced sediment supply enhances shoreline retreat. • Distinct from sand or muddy coasts, cliffs experience progressive erosion, which is largely caused by a combination of geotechnical instability, weathering on the upper cliff profile and wave action on the lower profile. The results of recent investigations reveal that, at approximately 15 per cent of all sandy beaches worldwide, the shoreline has been retreating, with an average trend of 1 m or more per year over the past 33 years, while almost half of the world’s sandy beaches are currently stable. • Many areas of the observed historical shoreline advance are related to reclamation and impoundment by coastal structures. Those human activities modify coastal dynamics, typically resulting in downdrift erosion. • Climate change impacts, including sea level rise and potential increases in the frequency and intensity of severe tropical and extratropical storms, can accelerate coastal erosion. Human activities have the strongest impacts on deltas and adjacent coasts, with potentially severe impacts on other coastal systems, such as sand spits, barrier islands and wave-dominated estuaries.\""

If allowed	to continue for the foreseeable future, such losses would constitute a lost natural capital asset worth trillions of dollars. • The large majority of small-scale, artisanal or subsistence	fishery landings were destined for local human consumption, thus contributing in a vital way to food security and nutrition in developing States, but illegal,	unreported or unregulated fishing continued to pose risks to many people who depended upon fisheries for protein, exacerbating poverty, augmenting food insecurity and potentially hindering efforts to achieve the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals. • Promisingly, scientific stock assessments	and management were shown to lead to more sustainable1 outcomes, and management reforms were predicted to lead to rapid (decade-scale) rebuilding of stocks. These were important lessons as the world began to look to unexploited and as yet unregulated fisheries in the	polar regions and the deep ocean (the mesopelagic zone). • The adverse effects of climate change on the oceans are expected to hinder sustainable outcomes, and fishery-dependent developing States, in particular their smallscale fisheries, are highly vulnerable to climate-related changes. \""

Since 2000, world aquaculture has ceased to enjoy the high annual growth rates of the 1980s and 1990s (11.3 and 10.0 per cent, respectively). Nevertheless, it continues to grow at a faster rate than other major food production sectors. Annual growth declined to a moderate 5.8 per cent during the period from 2000 to 2016, although double-digit growth still occurred in a small number of countries, in particular in Africa, from 2006 to 2010. Fish produced by this rapidly growing sector is high in protein and contains essential micronutrients, sometimes essential fatty acids, which cannot easily be substituted by other food commodities. • The United Nations predicts that the global population will reach 8.5 billion in 2030. This will inevitably increase the pressure on food sectors to increase production and reduce losses and waste. Production increases must be able to ensure sustainability, given a context in which key resources, such as land and water, are likely to be scarcer and the impact of climatic change will intensify. The aquaculture sector is no exception. Success in achieving the long-term goal of economic, social and environmental sustainability of the aquaculture sector, so as to ensure its continued contribution of nutritious food to keep the world healthy, will depend primarily on continued commitments by Governments to provide and support a good governance framework for the sector. As the sector further expands, intensifies and diversifies, it should recognize relevant environmental and social concerns and make conscious efforts to address them in a transparent manner, backed	 by scientific advice.	\""

"38"	"17"	2	5	"Changes in seaweed harvesting and use"	"\"As of 2012, about 80 per cent of	seaweeds were either consumed directly, such as kelps, or processed for phycocolloids, such as carrageenan, for use in the food industry. The rest were used widely in pet food and in industrial, cosmetic and medical applications. World production of seaweeds steadily rose from 2012 to 2017 at a rate of about 2.6 per cent annually, or about 1.8 million tons (wet weight) per year, owing mostly to demand from farming and aquaculture, with an estimated value of about $12 billion. • China remains the top producer of seaweeds, followed by Indonesia. The Philippines is still the world’s third largest producer, despite being struck by typhoons every year; Filipino seaweed farmers have become resilient and can revive their farming operations immediately. The Republic of Korea ranks fourth and has made a concerted effort to increase exports to North America through marketing campaigns. • The top species farmed are still the carrageenophytes, Kappaphycus alvarezii and Eucheuma spp. (accounting for 85 per cent of world’s carrageenan production), which are grown in the Indo-Pacific region; alginate-producing kelps (Saccharina and Undaria), which are cold-water species, are the major species harvested. • Emerging applications of seaweeds in agriculture include their use for the reduction of methane production in farmed animals, but such applications are still incipient because of issues relating to bromoforms, which can have environmental consequences. • Production has been affected negatively in typhoon-vulnerable areas.\""

It focuses on exploration licences for deepwater seabed mineral resources, the number of which has increased significantly since the first Assessment. • New technologies to reduce impacts on the marine environment are now envisaged for the exploitation of placer deposits, traditionally mined by dredging. Prospects for mining phosphorite deposits have faced opposition from stakeholders and have yet to become a reality. • Seabed mineral deposits covered in the present chapter (polymetallic nodules, polymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts) are being considered for mining and the object of 30 contracts for exploration awarded by the International Seabed Authority (ISA). • One driver for those activities is that deepwater seabed mineral resources contain diverse rare and critical metals that would support the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015.1 • The environmental impacts of the exploitation of those seabed mineral resources are a scientific community focus, and regulations are now being developed by ISA. • A lack of information on biodiversity, connectivity and ecosystem services exists, and a robust collection of baseline ecological data is necessary for predictions related to the future deepwater seabed mining activities, given the risk of irreversible damage to deep-sea ecosystems. • ISA has considered various financial models for the commercial mining of polymetallic nodules. Metal prices are difficult to predict, which can create significant risk that may delay commercial mining. • Deepwater seabed mineral resources are typically located far from human communities and the social impacts of their exploitation may be less than those of terrestrial mining. However, significant concerns exist about loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, including the role of the deep ocean in climate regulation. Those legitimate concerns constitute the basis for a “social licence to operate”."

The use of tension leg platforms, spars and floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) systems are key to such expansion. • In the next decade, frontier regions such as the eastern Mediterranean, the east coast of South America (Brazil and Guyana), and the west coast of Africa could be the major growth drivers for offshore oil and gas exploration and production. • There is an upward trend in decommissioning activity, in particular in mature regions, such as the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Exploration and production practices continue to evolve to minimize potential impacts on the surrounding environment. • The creation of regulatory capacity to manage offshore resources effectively, especially in frontier regions, requires significant commitment and long-term institutional investment. • Technological innovation and sophisticated industrial capability built over decades by the offshore oil and gas sector are benefiting the emergence of the marine renewable energy (MRE) industry. • A major thrust to the offshore hydrocarbon sector since the first Assessment is technological advancement in analysing offshore exploration and production data to enhance operational and financial efficiencies."

"42"	"22"	2	5	"Invasive species"	"\"Globally, about 2,000 marine non-indigenous species (NIS) have been introduced to new locations through human-mediated movements. A few of those have economic value, but most have had negative ecological, socioeconomic or human health impacts. With increased trade and climate change, biological invasions are likely to increase.
• NIS can pose significant biosecurity and biodiversity hazards. Large-scale NIS surveys with broad taxonomic coverage are lacking, as are studies documenting the range of potential impacts in recipient environments. • Major invasion vectors (i.e., ballast water, biofouling, aquaculture, trade in live specimens, canals and plastic or other debris) lack characterization and understanding at the global, and often regional, levels and, other than for the management of ballast water and sediments, there is an absence of regulation. Given the multi-vector nature of both the introduction and the spread of NIS, there is a need for comprehensive and integrated legal instruments with robust enforcement to mitigate the movement of species and holistic monitoring programmes that can detect them. • Better tools are urgently required to assess the potential risks of NIS under changing environmental conditions, to identify the native species and ecosystems most at risk and to determine the best way to respond (i.e., through early detection and rapid response). That is especially true for species with no previously documented invasion history.\""

However, that hypothesis is not widely supported at present and is not mentioned in the recent special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate. • Areas of gas seepage in the deep sea associated with gas hydrates host a very rich level of biodiversity supported by chemosynthetic bacteria. • Initial successes have recently been noted by China and Japan in producing methane from marine methane hydrates."
"45"	"25"	2	5	"Cumulative effects"	"Increasing pressures on marine environments from multiple sources are resulting in biodiversity loss, habitat damage and fragmentation and disease. • Effective implementation of ecosystem-based management requires an appreciation of how, and to what extent, human activities and natural events interact and affect different ecosystem components and their functioning. It also requires the identification of solutions to prevent and mitigate the pressures being caused by those interactions. • Over the past two decades, many frameworks for assessing the interactions, known as cumulative effects, have been developed. They have used differing approaches and terminologies and have been applied at differing levels. • Although approaches vary, cumulative effects assessments (CEAs) conducted to date have mostly involved three main steps: (a) collation of information on the intensity and footprint of activities that may be affecting marine ecosystems; (b) identification of the responses of ecosystem components; and (c) identification of management measures that could be applied in response. • Despite their increase in use, assessments focused on particular regions, areas or values that follow the same general steps outlined above are largely lacking from areas outside Europe and North America. • The geographical bias in the implementation of CEAs highlights clear knowledge and capacity gaps and the need for the development of approaches that: (a) can be implemented in regions where data are sparse; (b) are easily implementable; and (c) produce outputs that can be readily understood and are translatable to decision-making processes, in particular in developing countries."
"46"	"26"	2	6	"Developments in marine spatial planning"	"The growing scale of human activities and the associated impacts on the marine environment mean that conflicts are increasingly occurring between different uses of the ocean. Marine spatial planning (MSP) is an effective way of resolving such conflicts. • Over the past two decades, MSP has been instituted to a growing extent in many jurisdictions, in a variety of forms: some are simply zoning plans; others include more complex management systems. • The legal status of MSP varies between jurisdictions: in some, it is guidance to be taken into account; in others, it has legal force constraining specific management decisions. • In general, MSP has been most effective where it has been developed with the involvement of all relevant authorities and stakeholders."
"47"	"27"	2	6	"Developments in management approaches"	"\"The ecosystem approach is one of the most significant approaches to ocean management, consisting of the environmental, social and economic management of human interactions with oceans and coasts at multiple levels (transboundary, regional, national and local). • While there is general agreement that the ecosystem approach provides an effective framing of ocean management, further research and capacity-building are needed to realize its full potential benefits across the oceans. • Management has two different levels of governance, namely: decision-making processes that provide a framework for making decisions and implementing policy focused on the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources; and management tools (area-based and non-area-based) that can be used to regulate and modify human activity in a particular system.
• The implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development1 requires management grounded in the ecosystem approach in order to achieve the integrated set of global priorities and objectives set out in the Sustainable Development Goals. That will allow for the integration of interactions, benefits and trade-offs between the Goals and support the achievement of each of the ocean-related targets. • There is a growing trend towards incorporating the cultural values of the ocean into management.\""

However, the ecosystem services from marine and coastal ecosystems are deteriorating at an alarming rate, owing to several human pressures, including climate change. • Human activities are directly or indirectly affecting ecosystem services and can thus reduce or erase benefits that would otherwise be provided. As human activities in the marine environment are expected to increase in the future, in particular in areas beyond national jurisdiction, not only will they exert growing pressure on natural resources, but they may also threaten marine biodiversity and therefore the benefits that people obtain from ecosystem services. • International law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea1 plays a crucial role in the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and its resources and in safeguarding the many ecosystem services that the ocean provides for both current and future generations. Actions and efforts should be primarily focused on implementation and regulatory gaps, especially in areas beyond national jurisdiction. • That gives added significance to the current negotiations at the United Nations on the elaboration of an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. • The distribution around the world of the benefits drawn from the ocean is still very uneven. Efforts by less developed countries to take advantage of what the ocean can offer them are hampered by gaps in capacity-building and resource and financial constraints. • Capacity-building, shared scientific knowledge and collaboration to develop and transfer innovative marine technology will empower States to fully participate in and benefit from the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and its resources and assist them in meeting their obligations."
"49"	"1"	1	1	"Overall summary"	"Understanding of the ocean continues to improve. Innovations in sensors and autonomous observation platforms have substantially increased observations of the ocean. Regional observation programmes have expanded, with better coordination and integration. • Some responses for mitigating or reducing pressures and their associated impacts on the ocean have improved since the first World Ocean Assessment.1 They include the expansion and implementation of management frameworks for conserving the marine environment, including the establishment of marine protected areas and, in some regions, improved management of pollution and fisheries. However, many pressures from human activities continue to degrade the ocean, including important habitats, such as mangroves and coral reefs. Pressures include those associated with climate change; unsustainable fishing, including illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; the introduction of invasive species; atmospheric pollution causing acidification and eutrophication; excessive inputs of nutrients and hazardous substances, including plastics, microplastics and nanoplastics; increasing amounts of anthropogenic noise; and ill-managed coastal development and extraction of natural resources. • There continues to be a lack of quantification of the impacts of pressures and their cumulative effects. A general failure to achieve the integrated management of human uses of coasts and the ocean is increasing risks to the benefits that people draw from the ocean, including in terms of food safety and security, material provision, human health and well-being, coastal safety and the maintenance of key ecosystem services. • Improving the management of human uses of the ocean to ensure sustainability will require improved coordination and cooperation to provide capacity-building in regions where it is lacking, innovations in marine technology, the integration of multidisciplinary observation systems, the implementation of integrated management and planning and improved access to, and exchange of, ocean knowledge and technologies. • The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is having a major effect on many human activities carried out in the ocean.

Global disparities in understanding and knowledge gaps at the continental regional level remain, in particular across Africa, Oceania and South America. • Most observation networks do not incorporate the economic, social and cultural aspects of the ocean and, as a consequence, there is a lack of focused, publicly accessible observations of such aspects in standardized formats at the regional and global levels; such observations may be provided through work on supplemental national accounts."

The most notable differences are between temperate and tropical regions, and developed and least developed regions. • Integrated modelling frameworks, within which scenarios can be explored – including changes to people and economies, governance structures and the effects of climate change on maritime industries and the environment that are multisectoral and therefore provide whole-of-system approaches – allow for the identification of sustainable ocean use."
